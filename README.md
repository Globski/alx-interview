# Alx Interview Programming Projects

This repository contains a collection of Alx Interview programming projects covering various topics. Each project is designed to help you learn and practice different aspects of programming, primarily in Python.

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
|   [0x00-pascal_triangle](./0x00-pascal_triangle)  | This project involves creating a Python function that generates Pascal's Triangle and returns it as a list of lists. Each element in the triangle is derived from the sum of the two elements directly above it, with the edges of each row set to 1. This project helps strengthen skills in working with lists, defining functions, using loops, and performing basic arithmetic operations in Python. |
