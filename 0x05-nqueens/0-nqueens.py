N-Queens Solver

This script solves the N-Queens problem, which involves placing N non-attacking queens 
on an NÃ—N chessboard. The script uses the backtracking algorithm to find all possible 
solutions to the problem. It is designed to be executed from the command line with 
one argument, the size of the chessboard (N).

Usage:
    ./0-nqueens.py N
        Where N is the size of the board and the number of queens to be placed.
        The program will print all possible solutions to the N-Queens puzzle.
        
        If N is not provided or is less than 4, the program will print an error message
        and exit with status 1. If N is not a valid integer, an error message will also
        be printed, and the program will exit.

Exit Status:
    0  - If the program runs successfully and outputs the solutions.
    1  - If there is an error in the input or execution.
    
    Example:
    $ ./0-nqueens.py 4
    [[0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 0], [3, 2]]
    [[0, 2], [1, 0], [2, 3], [3, 1]]
    
    $ ./0-nqueens.py 6
    [[0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 5], [3, 0], [4, 2], [5, 4]]
    [[0, 2], [1, 5], [2, 1], [3, 4], [4, 0], [5, 3]]
    [[0, 3], [1, 0], [2, 4], [3, 1], [4, 5], [5, 2]]
    [[0, 4], [1, 2], [2, 0], [3, 5], [4, 3], [5, 1]]
