N-Queens Solver

This script solves the N-Queens problem, which involves placing N non-attacking
queens on an NÃ—N chessboard. The script uses the backtracking algorithm to find
all possible solutions to the problem. It is designed to be executed from
the command line with one argument, the size of the chessboard (N).

Usage:
    ./0-nqueens.py N
        Where N is the size of the board and the number of queens to be placed.
        The program will print all possible solutions to the N-Queens puzzle.

        If N is not provided or is less than 4, the program will print an error
        message and exit with status 1. If N is not a valid integer, an error
        message will also be printed, and the program will exit.

Exit Status:
    0  - If the program runs successfully and outputs the solutions.
    1  - If there is an error in the input or execution.

    Example:
    $ ./0-nqueens.py 4
    [[0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 0], [3, 2]]
    [[0, 2], [1, 0], [2, 3], [3, 1]]

    $ ./0-nqueens.py 6
    [[0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 5], [3, 0], [4, 2], [5, 4]]
    [[0, 2], [1, 5], [2, 1], [3, 4], [4, 0], [5, 3]]
    [[0, 3], [1, 0], [2, 4], [3, 1], [4, 5], [5, 2]]
    [[0, 4], [1, 2], [2, 0], [3, 5], [4, 3], [5, 1]]
